Self-Correcting Coding Assistant
This project introduces an intelligent assistant designed to detect and correct errors in Python code using artificial intelligence. It leverages the Lang Chain framework to facilitate interaction with large language models, specifically OpenAI’s GPT-4.
Key Features and Workflow
•	The assistant accepts a Python code snippet that may contain errors.
•	It analyses the code using an AI-powered language model.
•	It identifies both syntax and logical errors.
•	It generates a corrected version of the code.
•	It provides a concise explanation of the identified issues and the corresponding corrections.
System Components
1. Language Model (GPT-4 by OpenAI)
GPT-4 serves as the core intelligence behind the assistant. It is capable of understanding both natural language and programming logic. The model processes input prompts, consisting of user instructions and code snippets, and returns meaningful, corrected outputs.
2. Prompt Template
The prompt acts as an instruction manual for the AI. It guides the model by specifying:
•	That it should behave as a coding assistant.
•	That it should identify and correct code errors.
•	That it should provide an explanation for any changes made.
This structured approach ensures clarity and consistency in the model's responses.
3. LangChain LLMChain
LLMChain is a utility provided by LangChain that seamlessly connects the prompt template with the language model. This integration forms a reusable pipeline through which code snippets can be passed to receive intelligent and structured corrections.
4. Correction Function
The assistant’s functionality is encapsulated in a correction function. This function accepts a code snippet as input, processes it through the LLMChain, and returns the AI-generated response. It serves as a modular and reusable component within any application.
5. Test Execution
The assistant is tested using sample Python scripts containing intentional errors (e.g., incorrect function names or missing syntax). The system accurately detects the issues, suggests corrections, and provides clear justifications for each modification.
6. LangChain Agent
The agent acts as a more versatile interface, capable of interpreting natural language instructions and invoking appropriate tools. In this project, the self-correcting assistant is integrated as a tool within the agent’s framework. The agent can therefore handle open-ended prompts and autonomously determine when and how to utilize the correction tool.
